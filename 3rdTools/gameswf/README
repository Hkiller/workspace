Disclaimer form original project
================================

gameswf has bugs and quirks, and is not a complete implementation of Flash. The library as a whole is not highly optimized for memory use or speed. However, the text renderer is pretty decent, and the library is currently probably about as well implemented as the GUI library in the average commercial game. It has been used in many real projects but has a lot of rough edges.

How to use marmalade version
============================

Open and run demo GameSwfPortDemo.mkb
or, drop in GameSwf folder and associated mkf

Current State
=============

Compiles and runs on both x68 and ARM
Anti aliasing is not good quality
Doesn't handle device rotations well.

However, im interested in importing and rendering some simple UI assets, for that its working well

Problems
========

Heres my todo entries form the code.  They are really due to my limited understanding
of c++, so if anyone can advise/fix id be grateful :)


utility.h

//TODO - pete - this log2 causses errors on arm - for now im wrapping it an a conditional

#endif
